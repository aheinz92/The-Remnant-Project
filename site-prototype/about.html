  <h1>About The Remnant Project</h1>
  <p class="lead">The Remnant Project is dedicated to preserving, digitizing, and sharing the endangered stories and historical records of Black and Indigenous communities in Washington State at Tacoma Evergreen State College. The remnants of stories, struggles, and triumphs that shaped our cultural, social, and civic landscape. These pieces of our past, often overlooked or devalued, are treasures that deserve to be safeguarded and shared.</p>
  <p>Our mission is to preserve these stories in ways that honor the people they come from, using methods that break free from traditional practices that often strip away context and connection, and place them in the hands of the people. We are creating a digital archive, accessible online and in virtual reality, where these stories can be experienced, shared, and celebrated by everyone.</p>
  <p>We are also working to turn these archives into tools for learningâ€”state-approved curriculum that ensures our children grow up knowing the full history of the Black and Indigenous communities who helped shape this region. This will ensure that our history is taught in schools and cemented as part of our shared history for the next generation, and that we honor the legacy of our communities and creating a future where their contributions are impossible to ignore.</p>
