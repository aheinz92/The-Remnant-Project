                <p className="lead">The Remnant Project is dedicated to preserving, digitizing, and sharing the historical records and stories of Black and Indigenous communities in Washington State at Tacoma Evergreen State College.</p>

                <p>Our mission is to preserve these stories in ways that honor the people they come from, using methods that maintain authentic context and connection, and place them in the hands of the communities they represent. We are creating a digital archive, accessible online and in virtual reality, where these stories can be experienced, shared, and celebrated by everyone.</p>

                <p>We are also working to turn these archives into tools for learningâ€”state-approved curriculum that ensures future generations grow up knowing the full history of the diverse communities who helped shape this region. This will ensure that these important historical narratives are taught in schools and recognized as integral parts of our shared history, honoring the legacy of these communities and acknowledging their vital contributions.</p>
